Discourse Network Analyzer (DNA)
===

The Java software Discourse Network Analyzer (DNA) is a qualitative content analysis tool with network export facilities. You import text files and annotate statements that persons or organizations make, and the program will return network matrices of actors connected by shared concepts. There is also an R package called rDNA for integration with the statistical computing environment R.

##### Looking for the new version DNA 2.0?
We are actively working on the new version. A working beta version (2.0 beta 1 as of June 16th, 2015) is available on request, but it still lacks some features and may have some bugs. Contact us to get a copy of the .jar file. The new version is based on a database format and allows users to create custom statement types with arbitrary variables. We are planning to refine DNA 2.0 over the course of the next months and then release it here.
