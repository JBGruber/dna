## Discourse Network Analyzer (DNA) Manual

This is the most recent version of the DNA manual. It is written using **Sweave** with **R** code chunks and also employs **knitr**. You can compile your own PDF with the most recent changes. Just make sure you:

* Have [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed on your system.
* Have [**R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) installed on your system.
* Have [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your system.
* Have **DNA** and **rDNA** correctly set up on your system.

You can find instructions on how to install the programs in the last release version of the [manual](https://github.com/leifeld/dna/releases/download/v2.0-beta.20/dna-manual.pdf).

Then you need to choose **knitr** to weave .Rnw files in RStudio (Tools -> Global Options -> Sweave). Now you can download the manual folder from GitHub and compile it using the "Compile PDF" button in RStudio.
