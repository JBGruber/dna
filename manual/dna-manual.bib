abstract = {Chapter 7 by Sebastian Haunss examines discursive interactions in the public sphere. It conceptualizes these interactions as discourse networks and uses network analysis to probe whether a powerful discourse coalition drawing on a coherent repertoire of delegitimating arguments developed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Such a coalition would have been required to mobilize support for a Great Transformation of the capitalist market economy. However, the analysis reveals that discourse networks of relevant size and density emerged only in Germany and the United Kingdom. Even in these two countries, the critics of capitalism -- mainly journalists and members of the cultural and academic spheres -- were unable to form a broader, more powerful discourse coalition held together by an overarching delegitimating master frame.},
