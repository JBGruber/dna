  abstract = {The study of policy discourse comprises actor-centered and content-oriented
	approaches. We attempt to close the gap between the two kinds of
	approaches by introducing a new methodology for the analysis of political
	discourse called Discourse Network Analysis. It is based on social
	network analysis and qualitative content analysis and takes an entirely
	relational perspective. Political discourse can be analyzed in a
	dynamic way, and the approach makes previously unobservable cleavage
	lines and alignments measurable at the actor level, at the level
	of the contents of a discourse, and a combined layer. We compare
	discourse network analysis with political claims analysis, a competing
	method, and apply both methods to the European-level discourse on
	software patents. Our results demonstrate how an anti-software-patent
	coalition was mobilized and how it gained control over important
	frames, while the well-organized pro-software-patent discourse coalition
	was not able to gain sovereignty over the discourse.},
